<p> 1 EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MODULATING THE BEHAVIOR OF
     INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS by (<a href="Smailagic.html">Smailagic</a>,<a href="Asim.html">Asim</a>,<a href="Siewiorek.html">Siewiorek</a>,<a href="Daniel.html">Daniel</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes an audio-based emotion recognition system that
     is able to classify emotions in real-time. The emotion recognition
     system, according to some embodiments, adjusts the behavior of
     intelligent systems, such as a virtual coach, depending on the user's
     emotion, thereby providing an improved user experience. Embodiments of
     the emotion recognition system and method use short utterances as
     real-time speech from the user and use prosodic and phonetic features,
     such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral
     Coefficients, as the main set of features by which the human speech is
     characterized. In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention
     use One-Against-All or Two-Stage classification systems to determine
     different emotions. A minimum-error feature removal mechanism is further
     provided in alternate embodiments to reduce bandwidth and increase
     accuracy of the emotion recognition system.</p>

<p>Abstract

 Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells,
     for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and
     methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow
     configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different
     stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress
     is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells,
     the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to
     produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework,
     the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input
     with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are
     computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and
     computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the
     computer-implemented methods.</p>
<p> 3 RELIABILITY OF PHYSICAL UNCLONABLE FUNCTION CIRCUITS by (<a href="Mai.html">Mai</a>,<a href="Kenneth Wei-An.html">Kenneth Wei-An</a>,<a href="Bhargava.html">Bhargava</a>,<a href="Mudit.html">Mudit</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Techniques and circuits are disclosed for obtaining a physical unclonable
     function (PUF) circuit that is configured to provide, during a first
     operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric
     characteristic of the PUF circuit. Techniques and circuits described
     herein can cause the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by
     applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes a value of the
     electric characteristic relative to another value of the electric
     characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit; and
     adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the first electric
     characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another
     bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode of
     the PUF circuit.</p>
<p> 4 MICRONEEDLE ARRAYS FOR CANCER THERAPY APPLICATIONS by (<a href="Falo, JR..html">Falo, JR.</a>,<a href="Louis D..html">Louis D.</a>,<a href="Erdos.html">Erdos</a>,<a href="Geza.html">Geza</a>,<a href="Ozdoganlar.html">Ozdoganlar</a>,<a href="O. Burak.html">O. Burak</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

<p> 5 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method and non-transitory computer-readable medium capture an image of
     bulk grain and apply a feature extractor to the image to determine a
     feature of the bulk grain in the image. For each of a plurality of
     different sampling locations in the image, based upon the feature of the
     bulk grain at the sampling location, a determination is made regarding a
     classification score for the presence of a classification of material at
     the sampling location. A quality of the bulk grain of the image is
     determined based upon an aggregation of the classification scores for the
     presence of the classification of material at the sampling locations.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first
     mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in
     desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and
     limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism
     is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled
     along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby
     assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made
     limp and the process repeats. These innovations allow the device to drive
     anywhere in three dimensions. The device can "remember" its previous
     configurations, and can go anywhere in a body or other structure (e.g.
     jet engine). When used in medical applications, once the device arrives
     at a desired location, the inner core mechanism can be removed and
     another functional device such as a scalpel, clamp or other tool slid
     through the rigid sleeve to perform. Because of the rules governing
     abstracts, this abstract should not be used to construe the claims.</p>

<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>
