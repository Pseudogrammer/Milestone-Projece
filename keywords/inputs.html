<p> 1 RELIABILITY OF PHYSICAL UNCLONABLE FUNCTION CIRCUITS by (<a href="Mai.html">Mai</a>,<a href="Kenneth Wei-An.html">Kenneth Wei-An</a>,<a href="Bhargava.html">Bhargava</a>,<a href="Mudit.html">Mudit</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Techniques and circuits are disclosed for obtaining a physical unclonable
     function (PUF) circuit that is configured to provide, during a first
     operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric
     characteristic of the PUF circuit. Techniques and circuits described
     herein can cause the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by
     applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes a value of the
     electric characteristic relative to another value of the electric
     characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit; and
     adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the first electric
     characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another
     bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode of
     the PUF circuit.</p>
<p> 2 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>

<p>Abstract

 Present invention is an adjustable transfer device for unloading
     processed crop onto a container of a transport vehicle including a
     control arrangement with an electronic control unit, among other
     integrated components. Electronic control unit calculates position of
     expected point of incidence of crop flow on the container within field of
     view of optical image capture device, displays image of container
     together with symbol representing calculated expected point of incidence
     of crop flow on container on display, receives adjustment inputs from
     user interface for adjusting position of actuator and thus of adjustable
     transfer device, updates position of symbol in image on display, receives
     confirmation input from user interface once symbol in image on display is
     in appropriate position, derives at least one feature in image
     representing container, and tracks container within output signal of
     image processing system based on retrieved image feature and controls
     actuator accordingly to fill container with crop.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first
     mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in
     desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and
     limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism
     is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled
     along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby
     assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made
     limp and the process repeats. These innovations allow the device to drive
     anywhere in three dimensions. The device can "remember" its previous
     configurations, and can go anywhere in a body or other structure (e.g.
     jet engine). When used in medical applications, once the device arrives
     at a desired location, the inner core mechanism can be removed and
     another functional device such as a scalpel, clamp or other tool slid
     through the rigid sleeve to perform. Because of the rules governing
     abstracts, this abstract should not be used to construe the claims.</p>
<p> 5 BITCELL WTH MAGNETIC SWITCHING ELEMENTS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="lawrence.html">Lawrence</a>,<a href="Bromberg.html">Bromberg</a>,<a href="David M..html">David M.</a>,<a href="Sumbul.html">Sumbul</a>,<a href="Huseyin E..html">Huseyin E.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>
<p> 6 PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTIONS USING NEUROMORPHIC NETWORKS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="Lawrence Thomas.html">Lawrence Thomas</a>,<a href="Sharma.html">Sharma</a>,<a href="Abhishek Anil.html">Abhishek Anil</a>,<a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>,<a href="Thomas Christopher.html">Thomas Christopher</a>,<a href="Weldon.html">Weldon</a>,<a href="Jeffrey Arthur.html">Jeffrey Arthur</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an
     oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a
     physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an
     electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the
     initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the
     unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge
     signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the
     circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that
     there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the
     specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect
     to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and
     supply voltage.</p>
