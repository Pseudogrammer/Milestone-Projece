<p> 1 METHODS, DEVICES AND SYSTEMS FOR ALGAE LYSIS AND CONTENT EXTRACTION by (<a href="Higgs, III.html">Higgs, III</a>,<a href="C. Fred.html">C. Fred</a>,<a href="LeDuc.html">LeDuc</a>,<a href="Philip R..html">Philip R.</a>,<a href="Warren.html">Warren</a>,<a href="Kristin M..html">Kristin M.</a>,<a href="Mpagazehe.html">Mpagazehe</a>,<a href="Jeremiah N..html">Jeremiah N.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells,
     for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and
     methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow
     configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different
     stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress
     is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells,
     the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to
     produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework,
     the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input
     with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are
     computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and
     computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the
     computer-implemented methods.</p>
<p> 2 EXTENDABLE ARTICULATED PROBE DEVICE by (<a href="Zubiate.html">Zubiate</a>,<a href="brett.html">Brett</a>,<a href="Choset.html">Choset</a>,<a href="howard.html">Howard</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 An articulate probe device includes a first mechanism, a second
     mechanism, and an overtube mechanism. The first mechanism includes a
     proximal link which is movable coupled to a first intermediate link, a
     plurality of intermediate links, and a distal link which is moveably
     coupled to a second one of the intermediate links. The second mechanism
     includes a proximal link which is movable coupled to a first intermediate
     link, a plurality of intermediate links, and a distal link which is
     moveably coupled to a second one of the intermediate links. The overtube
     mechanism includes a proximal link which is movable coupled to a first
     intermediate link, a plurality of intermediate links, and a proximal link
     which is moveably coupled to a second one of the intermediate links.
     Further, at least one of the first mechanism, second mechanism, and
     overtube mechanism is steerable and extendable beyond the other
     mechanisms.</p>
<p> 3 RELIABILITY OF PHYSICAL UNCLONABLE FUNCTION CIRCUITS by (<a href="Mai.html">Mai</a>,<a href="Kenneth Wei-An.html">Kenneth Wei-An</a>,<a href="Bhargava.html">Bhargava</a>,<a href="Mudit.html">Mudit</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Techniques and circuits are disclosed for obtaining a physical unclonable
     function (PUF) circuit that is configured to provide, during a first
     operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric
     characteristic of the PUF circuit. Techniques and circuits described
     herein can cause the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by
     applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes a value of the
     electric characteristic relative to another value of the electric
     characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit; and
     adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the first electric
     characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another
     bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode of
     the PUF circuit.</p>
<p> 4 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>
<p> 5 STEERABLE, FOLLOW THE LEADER DEVICE by (<a href="Choset.html">Choset</a>,<a href="Howard M..html">Howard M.</a>,<a href="Wolf.html">Wolf</a>,<a href="Alon.html">Alon</a>,<a href="Zenati.html">Zenati</a>,<a href="Marco A..html">Marco A.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A highly articulated robotic probe (HARP) is comprised of a first
     mechanism and a second mechanism, one or both of which can be steered in
     desired directions. Each mechanism can alternate between being rigid and
     limp. In limp mode the mechanism is highly flexible. When one mechanism
     is limp, the other is rigid. The limp mechanism is then pushed or pulled
     along the rigid mechanism. The limp mechanism is made rigid, thereby
     assuming the shape of the rigid mechanism. The rigid mechanism is made
     limp and the process repeats. These innovations allow the device to drive
     anywhere in three dimensions. The device can "remember" its previous
     configurations, and can go anywhere in a body or other structure (e.g.
     jet engine). When used in medical applications, once the device arrives
     at a desired location, the inner core mechanism can be removed and
     another functional device such as a scalpel, clamp or other tool slid
     through the rigid sleeve to perform. Because of the rules governing
     abstracts, this abstract should not be used to construe the claims.</p>
