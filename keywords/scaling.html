<p> 1 BITCELL WTH MAGNETIC SWITCHING ELEMENTS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="lawrence.html">Lawrence</a>,<a href="Bromberg.html">Bromberg</a>,<a href="David M..html">David M.</a>,<a href="Sumbul.html">Sumbul</a>,<a href="Huseyin E..html">Huseyin E.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>
<p> 2 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>
<p> 3 PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTIONS USING NEUROMORPHIC NETWORKS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="Lawrence Thomas.html">Lawrence Thomas</a>,<a href="Sharma.html">Sharma</a>,<a href="Abhishek Anil.html">Abhishek Anil</a>,<a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>,<a href="Thomas Christopher.html">Thomas Christopher</a>,<a href="Weldon.html">Weldon</a>,<a href="Jeffrey Arthur.html">Jeffrey Arthur</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an
     oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a
     physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an
     electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the
     initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the
     unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge
     signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the
     circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that
     there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the
     specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect
     to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and
     supply voltage.</p>
