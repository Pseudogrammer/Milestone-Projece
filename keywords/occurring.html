<p>Abstract

 The present invention relates to .gamma.-PNA monomers according to
     Formula I where substituent groups R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4,
     R.sub.5, R.sub.6, B and P are defined as set forth in the specification.
     The invention also provides methodology for synthesizing compounds
     according to Formula I and methodology for synthesizing PNA oligomers
     that incorporate one or more Formula I monomers.</p>
