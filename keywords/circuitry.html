<p>Abstract

 A method and non-transitory computer-readable medium capture an image of
     bulk grain and apply a feature extractor to the image to determine a
     feature of the bulk grain in the image. For each of a plurality of
     different sampling locations in the image, based upon the feature of the
     bulk grain at the sampling location, a determination is made regarding a
     classification score for the presence of a classification of material at
     the sampling location. A quality of the bulk grain of the image is
     determined based upon an aggregation of the classification scores for the
     presence of the classification of material at the sampling locations.</p>
<p> 2 BITCELL WTH MAGNETIC SWITCHING ELEMENTS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="lawrence.html">Lawrence</a>,<a href="Bromberg.html">Bromberg</a>,<a href="David M..html">David M.</a>,<a href="Sumbul.html">Sumbul</a>,<a href="Huseyin E..html">Huseyin E.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>
<p> 3 PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTIONS USING NEUROMORPHIC NETWORKS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="Lawrence Thomas.html">Lawrence Thomas</a>,<a href="Sharma.html">Sharma</a>,<a href="Abhishek Anil.html">Abhishek Anil</a>,<a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>,<a href="Thomas Christopher.html">Thomas Christopher</a>,<a href="Weldon.html">Weldon</a>,<a href="Jeffrey Arthur.html">Jeffrey Arthur</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an
     oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a
     physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an
     electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the
     initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the
     unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge
     signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the
     circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that
     there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the
     specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect
     to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and
     supply voltage.</p>
