<p> 1 EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MODULATING THE BEHAVIOR OF
     INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS by (<a href="Smailagic.html">Smailagic</a>,<a href="Asim.html">Asim</a>,<a href="Siewiorek.html">Siewiorek</a>,<a href="Daniel.html">Daniel</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes an audio-based emotion recognition system that
     is able to classify emotions in real-time. The emotion recognition
     system, according to some embodiments, adjusts the behavior of
     intelligent systems, such as a virtual coach, depending on the user's
     emotion, thereby providing an improved user experience. Embodiments of
     the emotion recognition system and method use short utterances as
     real-time speech from the user and use prosodic and phonetic features,
     such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral
     Coefficients, as the main set of features by which the human speech is
     characterized. In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention
     use One-Against-All or Two-Stage classification systems to determine
     different emotions. A minimum-error feature removal mechanism is further
     provided in alternate embodiments to reduce bandwidth and increase
     accuracy of the emotion recognition system.</p>
<p> 2 METHODS, DEVICES AND SYSTEMS FOR ALGAE LYSIS AND CONTENT EXTRACTION by (<a href="Higgs, III.html">Higgs, III</a>,<a href="C. Fred.html">C. Fred</a>,<a href="LeDuc.html">LeDuc</a>,<a href="Philip R..html">Philip R.</a>,<a href="Warren.html">Warren</a>,<a href="Kristin M..html">Kristin M.</a>,<a href="Mpagazehe.html">Mpagazehe</a>,<a href="Jeremiah N..html">Jeremiah N.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells,
     for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and
     methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow
     configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different
     stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress
     is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells,
     the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to
     produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework,
     the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input
     with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are
     computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and
     computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the
     computer-implemented methods.</p>

     plurality of intermediate links, and a distal link which is moveably
     coupled to a second one of the intermediate links. The second mechanism
     includes a proximal link which is movable coupled to a first intermediate
     link, a plurality of intermediate links, and a distal link which is
     moveably coupled to a second one of the intermediate links. The overtube
     mechanism includes a proximal link which is movable coupled to a first
     intermediate link, a plurality of intermediate links, and a proximal link
     which is moveably coupled to a second one of the intermediate links.
     Further, at least one of the first mechanism, second mechanism, and
     overtube mechanism is steerable and extendable beyond the other
     mechanisms.</p>
<p> 4 RELIABILITY OF PHYSICAL UNCLONABLE FUNCTION CIRCUITS by (<a href="Mai.html">Mai</a>,<a href="Kenneth Wei-An.html">Kenneth Wei-An</a>,<a href="Bhargava.html">Bhargava</a>,<a href="Mudit.html">Mudit</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Techniques and circuits are disclosed for obtaining a physical unclonable
     function (PUF) circuit that is configured to provide, during a first
     operational mode, an output signal that is dependent on an electric
     characteristic of the PUF circuit. Techniques and circuits described
     herein can cause the PUF circuit to enter a second operational mode by
     applying a stress signal to the PUF circuit that changes a value of the
     electric characteristic relative to another value of the electric
     characteristic during the first operational mode of the PUF circuit; and
     adjusting, based on changing the absolute value of the first electric
     characteristic, a bias magnitude of the output signal relative to another
     bias magnitude of the output signal during the first operational mode of
     the PUF circuit.</p>
<p> 5 MICRONEEDLE ARRAYS FOR CANCER THERAPY APPLICATIONS by (<a href="Falo, JR..html">Falo, JR.</a>,<a href="Louis D..html">Louis D.</a>,<a href="Erdos.html">Erdos</a>,<a href="Geza.html">Geza</a>,<a href="Ozdoganlar.html">Ozdoganlar</a>,<a href="O. Burak.html">O. Burak</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>
<p> 6 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>

<p> 8 ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OF EMBEDDED MATERIALS by (<a href="Feinberg.html">Feinberg</a>,<a href="Adam.html">Adam</a>,<a href="Hinton.html">Hinton</a>,<a href="Thomas.html">Thomas</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
<p> 9 PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTIONS USING NEUROMORPHIC NETWORKS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="Lawrence Thomas.html">Lawrence Thomas</a>,<a href="Sharma.html">Sharma</a>,<a href="Abhishek Anil.html">Abhishek Anil</a>,<a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>,<a href="Thomas Christopher.html">Thomas Christopher</a>,<a href="Weldon.html">Weldon</a>,<a href="Jeffrey Arthur.html">Jeffrey Arthur</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an
     oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a
     physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an
     electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the
     initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the
     unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge
     signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the
     circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that
     there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the
     specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect
     to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and
     supply voltage.</p>
