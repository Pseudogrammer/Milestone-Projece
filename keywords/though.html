<p> 1 METHODS, DEVICES AND SYSTEMS FOR ALGAE LYSIS AND CONTENT EXTRACTION by (<a href="Higgs, III.html">Higgs, III</a>,<a href="C. Fred.html">C. Fred</a>,<a href="LeDuc.html">LeDuc</a>,<a href="Philip R..html">Philip R.</a>,<a href="Warren.html">Warren</a>,<a href="Kristin M..html">Kristin M.</a>,<a href="Mpagazehe.html">Mpagazehe</a>,<a href="Jeremiah N..html">Jeremiah N.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells,
     for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and
     methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow
     configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different
     stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress
     is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells,
     the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to
     produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework,
     the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input
     with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are
     computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and
     computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the
     computer-implemented methods.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>
<p> 3 BITCELL WTH MAGNETIC SWITCHING ELEMENTS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="lawrence.html">Lawrence</a>,<a href="Bromberg.html">Bromberg</a>,<a href="David M..html">David M.</a>,<a href="Sumbul.html">Sumbul</a>,<a href="Huseyin E..html">Huseyin E.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>

<p>Abstract

 Present invention is an adjustable transfer device for unloading
     processed crop onto a container of a transport vehicle including a
     control arrangement with an electronic control unit, among other
     integrated components. Electronic control unit calculates position of
     expected point of incidence of crop flow on the container within field of
     view of optical image capture device, displays image of container
     together with symbol representing calculated expected point of incidence
     of crop flow on container on display, receives adjustment inputs from
     user interface for adjusting position of actuator and thus of adjustable
     transfer device, updates position of symbol in image on display, receives
     confirmation input from user interface once symbol in image on display is
     in appropriate position, derives at least one feature in image
     representing container, and tracks container within output signal of
     image processing system based on retrieved image feature and controls
     actuator accordingly to fill container with crop.</p>
