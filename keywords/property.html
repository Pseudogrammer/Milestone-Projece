<p> 1 EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MODULATING THE BEHAVIOR OF
     INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS by (<a href="Smailagic.html">Smailagic</a>,<a href="Asim.html">Asim</a>,<a href="Siewiorek.html">Siewiorek</a>,<a href="Daniel.html">Daniel</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes an audio-based emotion recognition system that
     is able to classify emotions in real-time. The emotion recognition
     system, according to some embodiments, adjusts the behavior of
     intelligent systems, such as a virtual coach, depending on the user's
     emotion, thereby providing an improved user experience. Embodiments of
     the emotion recognition system and method use short utterances as
     real-time speech from the user and use prosodic and phonetic features,
     such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral
     Coefficients, as the main set of features by which the human speech is
     characterized. In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention
     use One-Against-All or Two-Stage classification systems to determine
     different emotions. A minimum-error feature removal mechanism is further
     provided in alternate embodiments to reduce bandwidth and increase
     accuracy of the emotion recognition system.</p>

<p>Abstract

 The present invention relates to .gamma.-PNA monomers according to
     Formula I where substituent groups R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4,
     R.sub.5, R.sub.6, B and P are defined as set forth in the specification.
     The invention also provides methodology for synthesizing compounds
     according to Formula I and methodology for synthesizing PNA oligomers
     that incorporate one or more Formula I monomers.</p>

<p>Abstract

 This invention provides an apparatus and method for culturing cells to
     probe the influence that the properties of a surface onto which the cells
     are bonded has on the properties of the cell.</p>
<p> 4 ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OF EMBEDDED MATERIALS by (<a href="Feinberg.html">Feinberg</a>,<a href="Adam.html">Adam</a>,<a href="Hinton.html">Hinton</a>,<a href="Thomas.html">Thomas</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
<p> 5 PHYSICALLY UNCLONABLE FUNCTIONS USING NEUROMORPHIC NETWORKS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="Lawrence Thomas.html">Lawrence Thomas</a>,<a href="Sharma.html">Sharma</a>,<a href="Abhishek Anil.html">Abhishek Anil</a>,<a href="Jackson.html">Jackson</a>,<a href="Thomas Christopher.html">Thomas Christopher</a>,<a href="Weldon.html">Weldon</a>,<a href="Jeffrey Arthur.html">Jeffrey Arthur</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes the use of a neural network circuit, such as an
     oscillatory neural network or cellular neural network, to serve as a
     physically unclonable function on an integrated circuit or within an
     electronic system. The manufacturing process variations that impact the
     initial state of the neural network parameters are used to provide the
     unique identification for the physically unclonable function. A challenge
     signal to the neural network results in a response that is unique to the
     circuits process variations. The neural network is designed such that
     there are random variations among manufactured circuits, but that the
     specific instance variations are sufficiently deterministic with respect
     to circuit aging and environmental conditions such as temperature and
     supply voltage.</p>
