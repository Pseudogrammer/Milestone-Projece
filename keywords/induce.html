<p>Abstract

 This invention provides an apparatus and method for culturing cells to
     probe the influence that the properties of a surface onto which the cells
     are bonded has on the properties of the cell.</p>

<p>Abstract

 Described herein are devices, systems and methods for lysing algae cells,
     for production of a lysate product such as a biofuel. The systems and
     methods use a passive device that lyses the cells through flow
     configurations, geometries, and surfaces that would induce different
     stresses and negative pressure on the microalgae cells. When the stress
     is designed to exceed the mechanical strength of the microalgae cells,
     the cells are lysed, causing, e.g., lipid release which can be used to
     produce biofuels. Through an internally-created computational framework,
     the concept is validated and can be optimized for the lowest energy input
     with the highest level of lipid release. Also provided herein are
     computer-implemented methods for optimizing lysis in such systems and
     computer-readable media containing instructions for performing the
     computer-implemented methods.</p>
<p> 3 MICRONEEDLE ARRAYS FOR CANCER THERAPY APPLICATIONS by (<a href="Falo, JR..html">Falo, JR.</a>,<a href="Louis D..html">Louis D.</a>,<a href="Erdos.html">Erdos</a>,<a href="Geza.html">Geza</a>,<a href="Ozdoganlar.html">Ozdoganlar</a>,<a href="O. Burak.html">O. Burak</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>
