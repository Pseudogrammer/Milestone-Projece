<p> 1 CONFORMATIONALLY-PREORGANIZED, MINIPEG-CONTAINING GAMMA-PEPTIDE NUCLEIC
     ACIDS by (<a href="LY.html">LY</a>,<a href="Danith H..html">Danith H.</a>,<a href="RAPIREDDY.html">RAPIREDDY</a>,<a href="Srinivas.html">Srinivas</a>,<a href="SAHU.html">SAHU</a>,<a href="Bichismita.html">Bichismita</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The present invention relates to .gamma.-PNA monomers according to
     Formula I where substituent groups R.sub.1, R.sub.2, R.sub.3, R.sub.4,
     R.sub.5, R.sub.6, B and P are defined as set forth in the specification.
     The invention also provides methodology for synthesizing compounds
     according to Formula I and methodology for synthesizing PNA oligomers
     that incorporate one or more Formula I monomers.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>
