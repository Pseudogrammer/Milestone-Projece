<p> 1 EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MODULATING THE BEHAVIOR OF
     INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS by (<a href="Smailagic.html">Smailagic</a>,<a href="Asim.html">Asim</a>,<a href="Siewiorek.html">Siewiorek</a>,<a href="Daniel.html">Daniel</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 The disclosure describes an audio-based emotion recognition system that
     is able to classify emotions in real-time. The emotion recognition
     system, according to some embodiments, adjusts the behavior of
     intelligent systems, such as a virtual coach, depending on the user's
     emotion, thereby providing an improved user experience. Embodiments of
     the emotion recognition system and method use short utterances as
     real-time speech from the user and use prosodic and phonetic features,
     such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, and Mel-Frequency Cepstral
     Coefficients, as the main set of features by which the human speech is
     characterized. In addition, certain embodiments of the present invention
     use One-Against-All or Two-Stage classification systems to determine
     different emotions. A minimum-error feature removal mechanism is further
     provided in alternate embodiments to reduce bandwidth and increase
     accuracy of the emotion recognition system.</p>

<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
<p> 3 BITCELL WTH MAGNETIC SWITCHING ELEMENTS by (<a href="Pileggi.html">Pileggi</a>,<a href="lawrence.html">Lawrence</a>,<a href="Bromberg.html">Bromberg</a>,<a href="David M..html">David M.</a>,<a href="Sumbul.html">Sumbul</a>,<a href="Huseyin E..html">Huseyin E.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 A method includes receiving a data bit value at a buffer in a bitcell
     based on a first state of a write bitline connected to the buffer, and
     transferring the data bit value from the buffer to a first magnetic
     switching cell in the bitcell for a later read operation at least by
     holding the write bitline to a reference value different from the first
     state, and asserting first and second predetermined voltage levels on
     respective first and second write wordlines connected to the buffer.</p>
