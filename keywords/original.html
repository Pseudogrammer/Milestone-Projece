<p> 1 FABRICATION, METHODS, APPARATUSES, AND SYSTEMS FOR ULTRA-COMPLIANT PROBES
     FOR NEURAL AND OTHER TISSUES by (<a href="Fedder.html">Fedder</a>,<a href="Gary K..html">Gary K.</a>,<a href="Ozdoganlar.html">Ozdoganlar</a>,<a href="burak.html">Burak</a>,<a href="Gilgunn.html">Gilgunn</a>,<a href="Peter J..html">Peter J.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant
     probe arrays that allows for design flexibility to match the stiffness of
     the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three
     axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section smaller than cell
     dimensions. Stiffness matching requires specific geometric and
     fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin probe wires.
     Sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions reduces glial
     formation. Further reduction in stiffness is obtained by incorporating
     different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the
     electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires
     commonly result in very high compliance. To enable effective insertion of
     the probes to the tissue, the present invention uses stiff biodisolvable
     and/or biodegradable polymers, including single use or combinations of
     carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol,
     maltose, other sugar molecules, polylactic acid and its co-polymers.</p>
<p> 2 OBJECT RECOGNIZER AND DETECTOR FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL IMAGES USING BAYESIAN
     NETWORK BASED CLASSIFIER by (<a href="SCHNEIDERMAN.html">SCHNEIDERMAN</a>,<a href="Henry.html">Henry</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 System and method for determining a classifier to discriminate between
     two classes--object or non-object. The classifier may be used by an
     object detection program to detect presence of a 3D object in a 2D image.
     The overall classifier is constructed of a sequence of classifiers, where
     each such classifier is based on a ratio of two graphical probability
     models. A discreet-valued variable representation at each node in a
     Bayesian network by a two-stage process of tree-structured vector
     quantization is discussed. The overall classifier may be part of an
     object detector program that is trained to automatically detect different
     types of 3D objects. Computationally efficient statistical methods to
     evaluate overall classifiers are disclosed. The Bayesian network-based
     classifier may also be used to determine if two observations belong to
     the same category.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method and non-transitory computer-readable medium capture an image of
     bulk grain and apply a feature extractor to the image to determine a
     feature of the bulk grain in the image. For each of a plurality of
     different sampling locations in the image, based upon the feature of the
     bulk grain at the sampling location, a determination is made regarding a
     classification score for the presence of a classification of material at
     the sampling location. A quality of the bulk grain of the image is
     determined based upon an aggregation of the classification scores for the
     presence of the classification of material at the sampling locations.</p>

<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
