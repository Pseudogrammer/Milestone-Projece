<p> 1 FABRICATION, METHODS, APPARATUSES, AND SYSTEMS FOR ULTRA-COMPLIANT PROBES
     FOR NEURAL AND OTHER TISSUES by (<a href="Fedder.html">Fedder</a>,<a href="Gary K..html">Gary K.</a>,<a href="Ozdoganlar.html">Ozdoganlar</a>,<a href="burak.html">Burak</a>,<a href="Gilgunn.html">Gilgunn</a>,<a href="Peter J..html">Peter J.</a>)</p>
<p>Abstract

 Methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant
     probe arrays that allows for design flexibility to match the stiffness of
     the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three
     axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section smaller than cell
     dimensions. Stiffness matching requires specific geometric and
     fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin probe wires.
     Sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions reduces glial
     formation. Further reduction in stiffness is obtained by incorporating
     different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the
     electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires
     commonly result in very high compliance. To enable effective insertion of
     the probes to the tissue, the present invention uses stiff biodisolvable
     and/or biodegradable polymers, including single use or combinations of
     carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol,
     maltose, other sugar molecules, polylactic acid and its co-polymers.</p>

<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>

<p>Abstract

 Present invention is an adjustable transfer device for unloading
     processed crop onto a container of a transport vehicle including a
     control arrangement with an electronic control unit, among other
     integrated components. Electronic control unit calculates position of
     expected point of incidence of crop flow on the container within field of
     view of optical image capture device, displays image of container
     together with symbol representing calculated expected point of incidence
     of crop flow on container on display, receives adjustment inputs from
     user interface for adjusting position of actuator and thus of adjustable
     transfer device, updates position of symbol in image on display, receives
     confirmation input from user interface once symbol in image on display is
     in appropriate position, derives at least one feature in image
     representing container, and tracks container within output signal of
     image processing system based on retrieved image feature and controls
     actuator accordingly to fill container with crop.</p>

<p>Abstract

 This invention provides an apparatus and method for culturing cells to
     probe the influence that the properties of a surface onto which the cells
     are bonded has on the properties of the cell.</p>

<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
