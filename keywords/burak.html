1 FABRICATION, METHODS, APPARATUSES, AND SYSTEMS FOR ULTRA-COMPLIANT PROBES
     FOR NEURAL AND OTHER TISSUES 

<p>Abstract

 Methods, systems and apparatuses of ultra-miniature, ultra-compliant
     probe arrays that allows for design flexibility to match the stiffness of
     the tissue it is being applied to, such as the brain tissue, in all three
     axes (x, y and z), with interconnect cross section smaller than cell
     dimensions. Stiffness matching requires specific geometric and
     fabrication approaches, commonly leading to ultra-thin probe wires.
     Sizing of the electrodes for specific cell dimensions reduces glial
     formation. Further reduction in stiffness is obtained by incorporating
     different geometric features to the electrode, such as meandering the
     electrode wires. The small thickness and geometric features of the wires
     commonly result in very high compliance. To enable effective insertion of
     the probes to the tissue, the present invention uses stiff biodisolvable
     and/or biodegradable polymers, including single use or combinations of
     carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol,
     maltose, other sugar molecules, polylactic acid and its co-polymers.</p>
2 MICRONEEDLE ARRAYS FOR CANCER THERAPY APPLICATIONS 

<p>Abstract

 A method of forming a microneedle array can include forming a microneedle
     array having one or more chemotherapeutic agents. The microneedle array
     can include a base portion and plurality of microneedles extending from
     the base portion, and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can be
     present in a higher concentration in the plurality of microneedles than
     in the base portion.</p>
