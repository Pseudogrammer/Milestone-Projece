<p>Abstract

 A method and non-transitory computer-readable medium capture an image of
     bulk grain and apply a feature extractor to the image to determine a
     feature of the bulk grain in the image. For each of a plurality of
     different sampling locations in the image, based upon the feature of the
     bulk grain at the sampling location, a determination is made regarding a
     classification score for the presence of a classification of material at
     the sampling location. A quality of the bulk grain of the image is
     determined based upon an aggregation of the classification scores for the
     presence of the classification of material at the sampling locations.</p>

<p>Abstract

 In one aspect, a method includes providing support material within which
     the structure is fabricated, depositing, into the support material,
     structure material to form the fabricated structure, and removing the
     support material to release the fabricated structure from the support
     material. The provided support material is stationary at an applied
     stress level below a threshold stress level and flows at an applied
     stress level at or above the threshold stress level during fabrication of
     the structure. The provided support material is configured to
     mechanically support at least a portion of the structure and to prevent
     deformation of the structure during the fabrication of the structure. The
     deposited structure material is suspended in the support material at a
     location where the structure material is deposited. The structure
     material comprises a fluid that transitions to a solid or semi-solid
     state after deposition of the structure material.</p>
